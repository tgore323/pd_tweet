This python program is written to make tweeting out live breaking news easier,
faster and more accurately. Obviously this is set up for the Los Angeles
area. Perhaps in the future I can make it easier to customize to other areas. 

<b>Please also be aware, that this program is currently a PROOF OF CONCEPT only.
This means that my code is mess, disorganized and probably filled with bugs.</b>

As with most of my software, it is free and open-source for the community.

Enjoy!
